# notification-schemas
Primarily intended as an area for initial dev and discussion of schemas describing the various OpenStack notifications.

Currently this is all hand-coded based on captured notifications and/or examination of source code.

The nova schemas were derived by examining the [Notigen templates](https://github.com/Stackforge/stacktach-notigen).

As yet, there is no validation of the these schemas for either syntactic or symantic correctness. However this will be coming soon. Code will be added here to validate these schemas against the official [JSON meta-schemas](http://json-schema.org/documentation.html).
